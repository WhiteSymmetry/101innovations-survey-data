# Discovering patterns in 20663 individual research workflows 
- using data from our recent global survey on Innovations in Scholarly Communication

## About

How cool would it be if you could analyze the current global state of scholarly communication and research practices not only by what people say, but by their active use of certain platforms, tools and websites? Well â€¦ now you can!

The results of our 2015-2016 survey on research tool usage (http://101innovations.wordpress.com) can provide insights into current practices across various fields, research roles, countries and career stages, and can be useful for researchers interested in changing research workflows. The data also makes it possible to correlate research tool usage to stance on Open Access and Open Science, and contains over 10,000 free-text answers on what respondents consider the most important developments in scholarly communication.

The full raw and cleaned dataset of the survey (20,663 responses) is available on [Zenodo] (http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.49583). Quick exploration of the survey results can be done in an [interactive dashboard on Silk] (http://dashboard101innovations.silk.co), but many more in-depth analyses are possible. To facilitate this, we also made the data available as [open dataset on Kaggle] (https://www.kaggle.com/bmkramer/101-innovations-research-tools-survey) where scripts (in R, Python, Julia) can be written, executed and shared. 

## Mozilla Science Lab Global Sprint 2016 (2nd - 3rd June, 2016)
During the upcoming [Mozilla Science Lab Global Sprint
2016](https://www.mozillascience.org/global-sprint-2016), we intend to make a head-start with these analyses by bringing together people with expertise in numerical and textual analysis. We invite all smart people, but especially those with experience in e.g. R, Python, Google Refine, NVIVO or AtlasTI. Any and all ideas for analysis are welcome! You are invited to join us, which you can announce here: https://ti.to/mozilla-science/gs2016-utrecht.

Please note that the sprint will take place between 9:00-13:00 on both days. Participants are of course free to continue working after these hours, and online support will be given wherever possible.
