# Real-life Open Science workflows: use and interoperability of research tools - How can I contribute? 

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our Mozfest2016 session 'Real-life Open Science workflows'! :tada:! 

## What will we be doing?
We will look at how Open Science practices can be combined into a full Open Science workflow. We also want to come up with concrete ideas to improve the use and interoperability of Open Science tools.
