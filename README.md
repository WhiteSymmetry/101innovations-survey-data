# Discovering patterns in 20663 individual research workflows 
- using data from our recent [global survey on Innovations in Scholarly Communication] (http://101innovations.wordpress.com) 

## About

How cool would it be if you could analyze the current global state of scholarly communication and research practices not only by what people say, but by their active use of certain platforms, tools and websites? Well â€¦ now you can!

The results of our 2015-2016 survey on research tool usage can provide insights into current practices across various fields, research roles, countries and career stages, and can be useful for researchers interested in changing research workflows. The data also makes it possible to correlate research tool usage to stance on Open Access and Open Science, and contains over 10,000 free-text answers on what respondents consider the most important developments in scholarly communication.

To facilitate collaboration on in-depth analysis, we made the data available as [open dataset on Kaggle] (https://www.kaggle.com/bmkramer/101-innovations-research-tools-survey) where scripts (in R, Python, Julia) can be written, executed and shared. Quick exploration of the survey results can be done in an [interactive dashboard on Silk] (http://dashboard101innovations.silk.co). The full raw and cleaned dataset of the survey (20,663 responses) is also available on [Zenodo] (http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.49583), but we recommend downloading the data from Kaggle (see above).

## Mozilla Science Lab Global Sprint 2016 (June 2-3, 2016)
During the [Mozilla Science Lab Global Sprint
2016](https://www.mozillascience.org/global-sprint-2016), we made a start with these analyses by bringing together people with expertise in numerical and textual analysis. 

During the sprint, we used this etherpad to share thoughts, ideas, code snippets etc.: https://public.etherpad-mozilla.org/p/sprintutrecht

## ReCon Hackday (June 25, 2016)
During the [ReCon Hackday 2016](https://reconevent.com/hackday/), we hope to continue to work on these analyses with the help of smart people present, especially those with experience in e.g. R, Python, Google Refine, NVIVO or AtlasTI. Any and all ideas for analysis are welcome!

## Mozfest2016 (Oct 28-30, 2016)
During [Mozfest2016](https://mozillafestival.org/), we want to explore to which degree researchers can and do employ a full Open Science workflow. This [session](https://app.mozillafestival.org/#_session-338) will be both on statistical analysis of survey results and technical appraisal of Open Science tools and platforms. 

During Mozfest, we will make use an [etherpad](https://public.etherpad-mozilla.org/p/mozfest-2016-real-life-open-science-workflows--use) to share thoughts, ideas and outcomes. We will also use a [specially created branch](https://github.com/bmkramer/101innovations-survey-data/tree/mozfest2016-Open-Science-workflows) of this repo. 

## Issue list
We added a [list of (broadly formulated) issues] (https://github.com/bmkramer/101innovations-survey-data/issues) to work on. Please add to them, add your comments and contribute where you can and want!
